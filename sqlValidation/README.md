# Validation Portion
## **Section A. Setting up SQLite**
1. Go to [SQLite's website](https://sqlite.org/download.html) and download the sqlite-amalgamation-3470000.zip.
2. Move the sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h files into the project directory.
3. Create the makefile accordingly.
4. For mine I used mingw32-make to build the project and ./validation to run it due to how I structured my makefile.
